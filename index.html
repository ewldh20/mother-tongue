    <h1>Welcome to Mother Tongue</h1>
    <p>Mother Tongue is an AI-driven language practice tool designed to help you unlock your full language potential through real conversations. While apps like Duolingo are great for learning words, true fluency comes from speaking. Scientifically, regular conversation practice builds neural pathways in your brain, helping you think in the language rather than just memorizing vocabulary.</p>
    <p>I created this app because I used to spend a fortune on tutors every week to practice speaking. Now, with Mother Tongue, I’ve developed a super simple, efficient, and much more affordable solution that can be fit around your schedule.</p>
    <p>You can select from many languages, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>English</li>
        <li>Mandarin</li>
        <li>Spanish</li>
        <li>French</li>
        <li>Italian</li>
        <li>Portuguese</li>
        <li>Japanese</li>
        <li>Arabic</li>
        <li>Turkish</li>
        <li>Danish</li>
        <li>Swedish</li>
        <li>Finnish</li>
        <li>Norwegian</li>
        <li>Greek</li>
        <li>Polish</li>
        <li>German</li>
        <li>Thai</li>
        <li>Hindi</li>
        <li>Urdu</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All other languages are also available - we are just in testing mode for them.</p>

<div id="change-locale" class="content">
    <h1>How to Change the Locale on Your Alexa</h1>
    <p>For the best experience with Mother Tongue, you should set your Alexa device to the relevant locale of the language you want to practice. This helps ensure proper conversation flow as Alexa will listen for the relevant language. You can change the locale by following the steps below:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Open the Alexa app on your smartphone or tablet.</li>
        <li>Tap on the **Devices** icon at the bottom of the screen.</li>
        <li>Select the **Echo & Alexa** option from the top menu.</li>
        <li>Choose the Alexa device you are using for Mother Tongue.</li>
        <li>Scroll down and tap on **Language**.</li>
        <li>Select the language you want to practice, for example, French (Français) or Spanish (Español).</li>
        <li>Save your changes. Alexa will now be set to listen and speak in the chosen language.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The great news is, you can change your locale as many times as you want, making it easy to switch back after your language session.</p>

<div id="best-practice" class="content">
    <h1>Best Practice for Using Mother Tongue</h1>
    <p>Using Mother Tongue is simple and effective for improving your language fluency. Here’s how to get started:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Start the Alexa skill by saying, <strong>"Alexa, open Mother Tongue."</strong></li>
        <li>Alexa will then ask, <em>"What language would you like to practice?"</em> Respond with the language you want to practice, such as <strong>“Francais”</strong> (for French) or <strong>“Espanol”</strong> (for Spanish).</li>
        <li>Next, Alexa will ask, <em>"For how long would you like to practice?"</em> Respond with the time in the relevant language. For example, say <strong>"Cinq minutes"</strong> (for five minutes) if you're practicing French, or <strong>"Diez minutos"</strong> (for ten minutes) if you're practicing Spanish. You can choose any duration between 1 and 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Alexa will then ask, <em>"What topic would you like to discuss?"</em> Again, reply in the language you're practicing. For instance, you could say <strong>"Cuisine"</strong> (for cooking) in French or <strong>"Preparándose para la cama"</strong> (for getting ready for bed) in Spanish.</li>
        <li>Finally, start speaking! Alexa will guide the conversation in the selected language. You can converse on the chosen topic in real-time with the AI.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Make sure to reply in the language of the locale you set (for example, French if you're practicing French, Spanish if you're practicing Spanish). This ensures a smoother interaction with the AI.</p>
    <p>Don’t forget: you can change the locale in your Alexa device as many times as you need, so feel free to switch between different languages whenever you like.</p>
