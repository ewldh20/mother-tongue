    <h1>Welcome to Mother Tongue</h1>
    <p>Mother Tongue is an AI-driven language practice tool designed to help you unlock your full language potential through real conversations. While apps like Duolingo are great for learning words, true fluency comes from speaking. Scientifically, regular conversation practice builds neural pathways in your brain, helping you think in the language rather than just memorizing vocabulary.</p>
    <p>I created this app because I used to spend a fortune on tutors every week to practice speaking. Now, with Mother Tongue, I’ve developed a super simple, efficient, and much more affordable solution that can be fit around your schedule.</p>
    <p>You can select from many languages, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>English</li>
        <li>Mandarin</li>
        <li>Spanish</li>
        <li>French</li>
        <li>Italian</li>
        <li>Portuguese</li>
        <li>Japanese</li>
        <li>Arabic</li>
        <li>Turkish</li>
        <li>Danish</li>
        <li>Swedish</li>
        <li>Finnish</li>
        <li>Norwegian</li>
        <li>Greek</li>
        <li>Polish</li>
        <li>German</li>
        <li>Thai</li>
        <li>Hindi</li>
        <li>Urdu</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other languages are also available in testing mode.</p>

    <h1>How to Change the Locale on Your Alexa</h1>
    <p>For the best experience with Mother Tongue, you should set your Alexa device to the relevant locale of the language you want to practice. This helps ensure proper conversation flow. You can change the locale by going to your Alexa app settings.</p>
    <p>The great news is, you can change your locale as many times as you want, making it easy to switch back after your language session.</p>
